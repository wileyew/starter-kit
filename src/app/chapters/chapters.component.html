    <p>To be clear, there are various types of tests that a quality engineer needs to be familiar with.
      When I started as a quality engineer, I literally looked up all the different types of tests that are applicable, however I found this
      <a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/types-of-software-testing/">site</a> to be the most comprehensive available for learning the different types of functional testing.
      Also, most teams will require a release test strategy for the web application they will be releasing to production.
      A release test strategy typically involves planning with a product spec review and then creating a release plan along with an estimate of the release date.
      The following information is what I would typically include in your release test strategy:<br></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Determine the release date of your minimal viable product that will go into production with your scrum team.</li>
<li>Determine the features that your team would like to prioritize together. </li>
<li>Discuss with your team on the framework for automation you'd prefer to use. </li>
<li>Test Data Management and CICD process </li>
<li>Performance Testing for the application, UI as well as API</li>
<li> End to end automation testing </li>
<li>Sign off on release strategy from your product owner as well as upper management. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I know you are looking at this list and saying to yourself, is this really doable?? Yes, it is and don't worry we will break down the aspects of this madness bullet by bullet!

<div id="minimumViable" class="chapters-subheadings">

<p>
  Every team must determine the minimal viable product that they want to ship to either internal or external customer.
  Every team member must coordinate with their teams to determine the release dates for the products they will ship to production.
  As you self organize with your team, the main topics to address are:
  1. Has enough value that people are willing to use it or buy it initially.
  2. Demonstrates enough future benefit to retain early adopters.
  3. Provides a feedback loop to guide future development.

<div id="releaseDate" class="chapters-subheadings">{{releaseDate}}</div>
<p>
As a quality enginner, or any role on a product development team, there is knowledge needed to be aware of the plans or estimates that your team will be comitting to as well as
when your product will actually be shipped to the end customer! I found a great <a href="https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/16372/how-do-you-schedule-delivery-dates-in-scrum">article</a> that explains the process of how release dates are calculated.
</p>
<div id="prioritizedFeatures" class="chapters-subheadings">{{prioritizationOfFeatures}}  </div>
<p>
Features must be prioritized by your product owner who controls the intent that will be worked on by the team. The team
then has weekly grooming sessions thereafterwards to make sure they are working on stories that have clearly defined
acceptance criteria that breaks down a story into deliverable behavior that the user of the product would normally utilize.

<div id="typesOfAutomationFrameworks" class="chapters-subheadings">{{automationFrameworks}} </div>
<p>
  One of the most important questions that quality engineers must consider is the type of test automation framework their team would like to use. I have found this resource helpful in determining which automation framework to use!

<div id="frameworkLanguage" class= "chapters-subheadings">{{languageFrameworks}} </div>
<p>
  One of the biggest decisions that a team will collectively make is the language that they utilize for their test automation. In my own personal opinion, it is important that teams choose the language
  of their automation framework based upon what they are comfortable with. For example, if a team is utilizing angular javascript for the web application, then it would be important for team members to choose
  javascript automation framework since it would be the same language as their web application. Glowtouch technologies has a great<a href="https://www.glowtouch.com/blog/testing/how-to-choose-the-right-test-automation-framework/"> article  </a>where they break down the different factors that lead to deciding on the most ideal test automation framework for your team!

  Informatica has a great <a href="https://blogs.informatica.com/2016/06/17/the-importance-of-test-data-management-for-devops-part-1/#fbid=msjnI1pGf5A"> article  </a> that explains the importance of maintaining and creating test data both in test environments such as a QA or dev environment as well as production!
  Once clean test data has been introduced for specific test environments for QA and DEV, it's important to implement a continuous testing solution into your own organization. Sauce labs has a great <a href="https://saucelabs.com/blog/you-cant-do-cicd-without-automated-testing"> article  </a>explaining the significance of test automation within the CICD process and various possible CICD solutions to implement within your own organization.
  Personally, I have in the past used Jenkins 2.0 as an enterprise product that allows us to implement CICD within our own organization.

  Below is the process that I have implemented in the past for CICD within the Capital One organization:
  1. Identify tests that will be tagged as smoke or regression tests and tag them with either @smoke, @regression, or assign a feature tag. Tag will be used by job to run those specific tests within the pipeline.
  2. Create a smoke job that will run sanity checks to verify that your application is sufficiently up and running.
  3. Create a regression job that will ensure that the critical functionalities of your web application are behaving as expected.
  4. Schedule the smoke job to run on a morning basis. I normally have our smoke jobs running when I get into the office, around 8-9AM.
  5. Schedule the regression job to be run on at least a weekly basis. This will also allow you to identify defects within the application that you would not have normally tested.
  6. Hook your test automation jobs to the delivery pipeline that developers utilize. For example, if code is merged and then successfully deployed to either the QA or dev environments, then create a pipeline that kicks off the smoke test automation.
  7. If your smoke test automation passes, then the code newly release is then tagged as a candidate for QA and is then released into the QA environment.

  Every organization has a responsibility for quality code, ensure that you discuss your CICD strategy with the entire team to get appropriate feedback and developing a viable solution.

  In order to performance test your application, there are multiple concepts that are important to understand first. The first
  part of the implementation of solid performance testing is to understand the transactions per second that an application must be capable of handling.
  The product owner for your team, or the person from your team handling the business side of your application must understand the transactions per second an application must handle.
  Once the desired transactions per second is determined by your product owner, it is important to do stress testing or load testing of the web application. This will allow the user to determine the maximum load a web application can withstand.
